# Introduction to python

### We would be answerig a few questions on the python programming language:

------

##### 1. Who developed python programming language?

Python programming language was created by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer. 
He took inspiration of the name 'python' from “Monty Python's Flying Circus”, a BBC comedy series from the 1970s 

------

##### 2. Which type of programming does Python support?

Python supports multiple programming paradigms including: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Imperative Programming, Functional Programming, Procedural Programming.
It is known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility, making it a popular choice for a wide range of applications, from web development to data science.

------

##### 3. Is python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?

Yes, Python is case sensitive when dealing with identifiers.

In Python, an identifier is the name given to variables, functions, classes, and other objects. 
For example, if you have a variable named "myVariable" and you try to refer to it as "myvariable", Python will consider it as a different identifier.

##### 4. What is the correct extension of the python file?

The correct extension for a Python file is ".py". 
This extension is used to identify a file as a Python script and allows other programs, such as the Python interpreter, to recognize and execute the contents of the file as Python code.

------

##### 5. Is python code compiled or interpreted?

Python code is interpreted, not compiled.

Interpreted code is executed line by line by an interpreter, rather than being translated into machine code and executed directly by the computer's processor. This makes it easier to develop and debug Python code, but can also result in slower performance compared to compiled languages.

------

##### 6. Name a few blocks of code used to define in python language?

In Python, several blocks of code are used to define different structures such as functions, classes, loops, and conditionals. Some of the most common blocks of code used in Python include:

- **Functions**: defined using the "def" keyword, functions allow you to encapsulate a block of code that can be reused throughout your program.

- **Classes**: classes are used to define objects and their behavior in object-oriented programming. They are defined using the "class" keyword.

- **Loops**: used for repetitive operations, there are two main types of loops in Python: "for" loops and "while" loops.

- **Conditionals**: conditionals allow you to specify conditions under which certain code should be executed. The most common conditional statement in Python is the "if" statement.

------

##### 7. State a character used to give single line comments in python?

In Python, a single-line comment can be added by starting the line with the pound symbol ('#'). Everything following the pound symbol on that line will be ignored by the Python interpreter and will not be executed.

------

##### 8. Mention functions which can help us find the version of python that we are currently working on?

Following functions to determine the version of Python that you are currently working with:

⋅⋅* **sys.version**: Returns a string containing information about the Python version you are using, including the version number and build information.
⋅⋅* **sys.version_info**: Returns a named tuple that contains information about the version of Python you are using, including the major, minor, and micro version numbers.
⋅⋅* **platform.python_version()**: Returns a string containing the version of Python you are using.

------

##### 9. Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using which construct?

In Python, anonymous functions can be created at runtime using the **"lambda"** construct. A lambda function is a small, anonymous function that can take any number of arguments and return a single expression value.

------

##### 10. What does 'pip' stand for in python?

"pip" stands for **"Pip Installs Packages**." It is a package management system used to install and manage packages and libraries for Python. With pip, you can easily install and manage packages and libraries needed for your Python projects.

------

##### 11. Mention a few built-in functions in python?

⋅⋅* print(): Prints the specified message to the console.

⋅⋅* len(): Returns the length of an object, such as a string or list.

⋅⋅* range(): Generates a sequence of numbers, which can be used to iterate over with a for loop.

⋅⋅* sum(): Adds up all the numbers in a list or other iterable object.

⋅⋅* min() and max(): Return the minimum and maximum values from a list or other iterable object.

⋅⋅* sorted(): Returns a sorted list from an iterable object.

⋅⋅* abs(): Returns the absolute value of a number.

⋅⋅* str(), int(), float(): Convert a value to a string, integer, or floating-point number, respectively.

------

##### 12. What is the maximum possible length of an identifier in Python?

There is no maximum length specified for an identifier in Python. However, there is a practical limit to the length of an identifier imposed by the underlying operating system and the file system used to store the Python code.

Typically, **most operating systems** and file systems have a **limit of 255 characters** for the length of a file name, which would also be the maximum length of an identifier in Python. However, this limit may vary depending on the specific system being used, and it is always a good idea to keep your identifier names short and descriptive.

------

##### 13. What are the benefits of using Python?

Some of the key benefits are:

⋅⋅* Easy to Learn and Use: Python has a simple and intuitive syntax, making it an ideal language for beginners to learn. It is also easy to read and write, which makes it an efficient choice for many tasks.

⋅⋅* Versatile: Python is a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.

⋅⋅* Large Community: Python has a large and growing community of developers, making it easier to find help and resources when needed. The community also contributes to the development of Python libraries, which makes it easier to perform complex tasks.

⋅⋅* Plenty of Libraries and Frameworks: Python has a wealth of libraries and frameworks that provide additional functionality, making it easier to accomplish complex tasks without having to write everything from scratch. Some popular libraries include NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and TensorFlow.

⋅⋅* Interoperability: Python can easily integrate with other programming languages, such as C, C++, and Java, making it easier to use existing code and systems. This can save time and reduce the amount of code you need to write.
